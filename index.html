  <h2>Why Zoo of Centralities is needed?</h2>
  <p>
    The study of centrality has evolved rapidly. Over the years, scientists have introduced an enormous number of centrality metrics, creating a zoo of diverse and distinct approaches.

  <p>
  The vast number of centrality measures introduced over time has created several key challenges:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Discoverability:</strong> many measures remain hard to find and unfamiliar to researchers.</li>
  <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> most measures lack available implementations, limiting their practical use.</li>
  <li><strong>Redundancy:</strong> many models are often reinvented independently, causing duplication.</li>
  <li><strong>Naming conflicts:</strong> without a unified classification, different measures sometimes share the same names (e.g. topological coefficient or local centrality), leading to confusion.</li>
  <li><strong>Validation issues:</strong> new measures are often compared only to traditional metrics, ignoring more suitable or advanced options, which makes proper evaluation difficult.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>CentralityZoo</strong> was created to overcome these obstacles by organizing this complex landscape, offering clear information, and enabling researchers to access and apply a broad range of centrality measures with ease.
