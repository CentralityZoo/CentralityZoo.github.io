  <h1>Welcome to <strong>Zoo of Centralities</strong></h1>
  <p><em>A continually updated encyclopedia of centrality measures in complex networks</em></p>

<section id="motivation">
  <h2>Why Zoo of Centralities is needed?</h2>
  <p>
    The study of centrality has evolved rapidly. Over the years, scientists have introduced an enormous number of centrality metrics, creating a zoo of diverse and distinct approaches.
  </p>

  <p>
    But despite the richness of this field, we noticed a problem:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Key measures are scattered across papers and toolkits</li>
    <li>Definitions can be confusing or inconsistent</li>
    <li>Side-by-side comparisons are rare</li>
    <li>And new learners often ask: <em>“Which centrality should I use—and why?”</em></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We built <strong>CentralityZoo</strong> to answer that question, organize the space, and make learning <strong>clear</strong>, <strong>visual</strong>, and <strong>accessible</strong>.

  <h2>🧭 What Is Centrality?</h2>
  <p>
    Centrality metrics attempt to capture <strong>how important</strong> or <strong>influential</strong> a node is within the structure of a network. Each metric reflects a different idea of what “importance” means:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>🧍 <strong>Degree Centrality</strong> – Who has the most direct connections?</li>
    <li>🧠 <strong>Eigenvector Centrality</strong> – Who is connected to the well-connected?</li>
    <li>🔗 <strong>Closeness Centrality</strong> – Who can reach others most efficiently?</li>
    <li>🧬 <strong>Betweenness Centrality</strong> – Who sits on the most paths?</li>
    <li>📦 <strong>PageRank</strong> – Who has prestige based on network structure?</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="zoo">
  <h2>🐾 Why “Zoo”?</h2>
  <p>
    Because this is a <strong>collection</strong>—a curated, growing exhibit of the diverse “species” of centrality.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Explained in plain language</li>
    <li>Includes mathematical definitions</li>
    <li>Comes with visualizations and code</li>
    <li>Can be compared on real-world networks</li>
  </ul>
