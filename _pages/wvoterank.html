 The
 <i>
  WVoteRank
 </i>
 centrality is a modification of VoteRank that incorporates both the number of neighbors and the weight of each link [2]. Each node \(i\) is represented by the tuple \((s_i, v_i)\), where \(s_i\) is the voting score and \(v_i\) is the voting ability, initialized as \((s_i, v_i) = (0, 1)\) for all \(i \in \mathcal{N}\). The voting procedure iteratively performs the following steps:
 <ol>
  <li>
   <i>
    Vote:
   </i>
   Each node votes for its neighbors based on its voting ability. The voting score of node \(i\) is updated as
    \begin{equation*}
        s_i = \sqrt{d_i \sum_{j=1}^{N} w_{ji} v_j},
    \end{equation*}
    where \(w_{ji}\) is the weight of the link from node \(j\) to node \(i\) and \(d_i\) is the degree of node \(i\).
  </li>
  <li>
   <i>
    Select:
   </i>
   The node \(k\) with the highest voting score \(s_k\) is elected. Node \(k\) will not participate in subsequent voting turns, i.e., its voting ability is set to zero (\(v_k = 0\)).
  </li>
  <li>
   <i>
    Update:
   </i>
   The voting ability of nodes that voted for \(k\) is reduced to account for influence spread. For each neighbor \(i \in \mathcal{N}(k)\), the updated voting ability is
    \begin{equation*}
        v_i \leftarrow \max(0, v_i - f),
    \end{equation*}
    where \(f\) is typically set to the inverse of the average degree of the network, i.e. \(f=1/\langle d \rangle\).
  </li>
 </ol>
 WVoteRank prioritizes nodes that are both well-connected and linked through high-weight edges, ensuring that influential nodes are identified while accounting for the propagation of influence through their neighbors.
