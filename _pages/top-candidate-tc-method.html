 The
 <i>
  Top Candidate
 </i>
 (TC) method  is an iterative voting-based algorithm originally designed to detect experts in a community and later applied to identify innovators and early adopters in social networks [2, 3]. The TC method focuses on identifying a
 <i>
  stable set
 </i>
 of mutually reinforcing expert candidates whose nominations support one another. The approach relies on the assumption that experts tend to nominate other experts more reliably than non-experts. The algorithm proceeds through the following steps:
 <ol>
  <li>
   <i>
    Initialization:
   </i>
   all nodes are initially considered experts.
  </li>
  <li>
   <i>
    Nomination:
   </i>
   each node selects an \( α \)-fraction of its most popular neighbors as nominees, with popularity defined as the (weighted) in-degree and \( α \in [0, 1] \).
  </li>
  <li>
   <i>
    Elimination:
   </i>
   nodes that receive no nominations are removed from the expert set. All nominations issued by these removed nodes are discarded as well.
  </li>
  <li>
   <i>
    Update:
   </i>
   the elimination in Step 3 may cause additional nodes to lose all incoming nominations. These nodes are likewise removed, and the process is repeated until no further removals occur.
  </li>
 </ol>
 The resulting set of nodes constitutes the
 <i>
  stable expert set
 </i>
 . A set \( S \subseteq \mathcal{N} \) is stable if (i) every node in \( S \) is nominated by at least one other node in \( S \) and (ii) all nominees of any node in \( S \) are also contained in \( S \). The parameter \( α \) controls the exclusiveness of the selection: smaller values of \( α \) lead to more restrictive nomination sets and thus smaller expert groups, whereas larger values of \( α \) generally produce more inclusive and larger stable sets.
