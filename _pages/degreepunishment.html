  DegreePunishment
 </i>
 is a degree-based heuristic for identifying influential nodes in a network [2]. The central idea is that once a node \(i\) is selected as a seed, it should “punish” or restrict the selection of its neighbors in the subsequent steps. DegreePunishment iteratively performs the following steps:
 <br/>
 <ol>
  <br/>
  <li>
   Compute the degree \(d_i\) of each node \(i\) and initialize \(dp_i = d_i\).
  </li>
  <br/>
  <li>
   Select the node \(i\) with the largest \(dp_i\) and add it to the seed set. The punishment that node \(i\) imposes on node \(j\) is calculated as
    \[
    p_{ij} = d_i \sum_{h=1}^{r} (A^h)_{ij} \, ω^h,
    \]
    where \(r\) defines the radius of influence (maximum path length) and \(ω\) is a weakening factor. The value of \(dp_j\) is then updated for each node \(j\) as
    \[
    dp_j = d_j - \sum_{i \neq j} p_{ij} \, σ_i,
    \]
    where \(σ_i\) is an indicator function such that \(σ_i = 1\) if node \(i\) has already been selected as a seed, and \(σ_i = 0\) otherwise.
  </li>
  <br/>
  <li>
   Repeat step 2 until \(k\) nodes have been selected for the seed set.
  </li>
  <br/>
 </ol>
 <br/>
 Due to computational complexity, Wang et al. [2] restrict the punishment to paths of length \(r \le 2\) and suggest using \(ω = β_c\), where \(β_c\) is the spreading threshold of the graph \(G\).
