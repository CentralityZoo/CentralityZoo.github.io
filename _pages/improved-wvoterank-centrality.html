 The
 <i>
  improved WVoteRank centrality
 </i>
 is a modification of WVoteRank that incorporates both 1-hop and 2-hop neighbors in the voting process [2]. Each node \(i\) is characterized by the tuple \((s_i, v_i)\), where \(s_i\) is the voting score and \(v_i\) is the voting ability. Initially, \((s_i, v_i) = (0,1)\) for all \(i \in \mathcal{N}\). The voting procedure iteratively performs the following steps:
 <br/>
 <ol>
  <br/>
  <li>
   <i>
    Vote:
   </i>
   each node distributes votes to its neighbors. The voting score of node \(i\) is computed as
    \begin{equation*}
        s_i = \sqrt{ d_i \sum_{j=1}^{N} w_{ij} v_j + \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} \sum_{k \in \mathcal{N}(j) \setminus \{i\}} w_{jk} v_k },
    \end{equation*}
    where \(w_{ij}\) is the weight of the edge \((i,j)\), \(d_i\) is the degree of node \(i\) and \(\mathcal{N}(j)\) denotes the neighbors of node \(j\).
  </li>
  <br/>
  <li>
   <i>
    Select:
   </i>
   the node \(k\) with the highest voting score \(s_k\) is elected. This node is removed from subsequent voting rounds by setting its voting ability to zero, \(v_k = 0\).
  </li>
  <br/>
  <li>
   <i>
    Update:
   </i>
   the voting ability of nodes within the 2-hop neighborhood of the elected node is reduced. For each \(j \in \mathcal{N}^{( \leq 2)}(k)\), the updated voting ability is
    \begin{equation*}
        v_j \leftarrow \max(0, v_j - f_{kj}),
    \end{equation*}
    where \(f_{kj} = \frac{1}{\langle d \rangle d_{kj}}\), \(\langle d \rangle\) is the average degree of the network, and \(d_{kj}\) is the shortest-path distance from the elected node \(k\).
  </li>
  <br/>
 </ol>
 <br/>
 The improved WVoteRank centrality accounts for both direct and indirect neighbors, ensuring that the influence of selected nodes appropriately diminishes the voting power of surrounding nodes.
