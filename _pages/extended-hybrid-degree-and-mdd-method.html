 The
 <i>
  extended hybrid degree and MDD method
 </i>
 ranks nodes in complex networks by considering both the mixed degree decomposition (MDD) index and the degree of each node and its neighbors [2]. It extends the hybrid degree and MDD centrality (\(c_{x\text{-}MDD}\)) by defining the centrality of node \(i\) as the sum of the \(c_{x\text{-}MDD}\) scores of its immediate neighbors:\[c_{\text{ex-MDD}}(i) = \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} c_{x\text{-}MDD}(j)= \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} \left( MDD(j) \sum_{k \in \mathcal{N}^{(\leq r)}(j)} \frac{d_k}{d_{jk}^2} \right),\]where \(\mathcal{N}(i)\) denotes the set of neighbors of node \(i\), \(\mathcal{N}^{(\leq r)}(j)\) is the set of nodes within distance \(r\) from node \(j\) (excluding \(j\) itself), \(MDD(j)\) and \(d_j\) are the MDD index and degree of node \(j\), and \(d_{jk}\) is the shortest path distance between nodes \(j\) and \(k\).

 [2] consider a three-hop neighborhood, i.e., \(r = 3\).The extended hybrid degree and MDD method has been evaluated using the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model and metrics such as spreadability, monotonicity, and Kendall’s tau, demonstrating superior performance compared to several existing centrality measures in identifying influential seed nodes on real networks.
